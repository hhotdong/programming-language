# Object

> "An object is an entity that performs computations and has a local state. It may therefore be viewed as a combination of data and procedural elements."[^object_definition]

# OOP

> "Object-oriented programming is a method of implementation in which
> (1) Objects are the fundamental building blocks
> (2) Each object is an instance of some type(or class).
> (3) Classes are related to each other by inheritance relationships. (Programming methods that do not use inheritance are not considered to be object-oriented."[^oop_definition]
